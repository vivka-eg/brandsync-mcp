# Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Claude Code OAuth Completes But Connection Fails

**Symptoms:**
- Using Claude Code with `claude mcp add --transport sse`
- OAuth opens in browser and you authorize successfully
- Connection never establishes after OAuth
- Server shows "figma-console: not connected" in `/mcp`

**Cause:**
This is a [known bug in Claude Code's HTTP/SSE transport](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/2466). The native SSE transport doesn't properly reconnect after completing the OAuth flow.

**Solution:**
Use the `mcp-remote` package instead of Claude Code's native SSE transport:

```bash
claude mcp add figma-console -s user -- npx -y mcp-remote@latest https://figma-console-mcp.southleft.com/sse
```

Or add to `~/.claude.json` manually:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma-console": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote@latest", "https://figma-console-mcp.southleft.com/sse"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Code (`/mcp` to reconnect) — mcp-remote will open a browser for OAuth, and the connection will work correctly.

**Alternative:** If you're using Claude Code, consider using [Local Mode](/setup#local-mode-setup-advanced) instead. It provides the full feature set including the Desktop Bridge plugin, and doesn't require OAuth (uses a Personal Access Token).

### Plugin Debugging: Simple Workflow ✅

**For Plugin Developers in Local Mode:**

> **FIRST-TIME SETUP:**
>
> 1. Open Figma Desktop normally (no special flags needed)
> 2. Go to **Plugins → Development → Import plugin from manifest...**
> 3. Select `~/.figma-console-mcp/plugin/manifest.json` (stable path created automatically by the MCP server)
> 4. Run the plugin in your Figma file — it auto-connects via WebSocket
>
> ✅ **One-time import.** The plugin uses a bootloader architecture that dynamically loads the latest UI from the MCP server each time it opens. You never need to re-import the manifest when the MCP server updates — the bootloader handles it automatically.

### How to Verify Setup is Working

Before trying to get console logs, verify your setup:

```
"Check Figma status"
```

You should see something like:
```json
{
  "setup": {
    "valid": true,
    "message": "✅ Figma Desktop connected via WebSocket (Desktop Bridge Plugin)"
  }
}
```

If you see `"valid": false`, the AI will provide step-by-step setup instructions.

### WebSocket Bridge Troubleshooting

#### Plugin Shows "Disconnected"
**Cause:** MCP server is not running (it hosts the WebSocket server on ports 9223–9232).
**Fix:** Start or restart your MCP client (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) so the MCP server process starts.

#### Plugin Not Appearing in Development Plugins
**Cause:** Plugin manifest not imported.
**Fix:** Go to Figma → Plugins → Development → Import plugin from manifest... → select `figma-desktop-bridge/manifest.json`.

#### Port 9223 Already in Use
**Cause:** Another MCP server instance or orphaned process is running on port 9223.
**Fix:** As of v1.14.0, the server automatically cleans up orphaned MCP processes on startup and falls back to the next available port in the range 9223–9232. The bootloader plugin scans all ports automatically — no manual intervention needed.

#### Plugin Shows "MCP scanning" or "Retry"
**Cause:** The MCP server is not running yet, or all ports 9223–9232 are occupied.
**Fix:** Start your MCP client (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) so the MCP server process starts. If you have many stale processes holding ports, restart Claude Desktop to clear them — the next MCP server startup will clean up any remaining orphans automatically.

#### Plugin Shows "No MCP server found"
**Cause:** The bootloader scanned all ports and found no live MCP server.
**Fix:** Make sure an MCP client is running with figma-console-mcp configured. Check `figma_get_status` from your AI client.

#### Orphaned MCP Processes Filling Port Range
**Cause:** Claude Desktop can leave orphaned MCP server processes running after tabs close (known Claude Desktop issue).
**Fix:** As of v1.14.0, the server automatically detects and terminates orphaned figma-console-mcp processes on startup. If you need to manually clean up, run: `lsof -i :9223-9232 | grep LISTEN` to see what's holding ports.

> **How the bootloader works:** The Desktop Bridge plugin uses a thin bootloader that dynamically loads the full plugin UI from the MCP server each time it opens. Figma caches the bootloader (which never needs updating), and the actual UI code is always fetched fresh from the running server. This eliminates the need to re-import the manifest when the MCP server updates.

> **Stable plugin path:** The MCP server automatically copies plugin files to `~/.figma-console-mcp/plugin/` on startup. Import from this path instead of the volatile npx cache path.

#### Running in Docker
**Cause:** The WebSocket server binds to `localhost` by default, which is unreachable from the Docker host.
**Fix:** Set `FIGMA_WS_HOST=0.0.0.0` in your container environment and expose the port with `-p 9223:9223`.

#### Plugin Connected but Commands Timeout
**Cause:** Plugin may be running in a different Figma file than expected.
**Fix:** The MCP server routes commands to the active file. Make sure the Desktop Bridge Plugin is running in the file you want to work with. Use `figma_get_status` to see which file is connected.

### The Simplest Workflow - No Navigation Needed!

Once setup is complete, just ask your AI to check console logs:

```
"Check the last 20 console logs"
```

Then run your plugin in Figma Desktop, and ask again:

```
"Check the last 20 console logs"
```

You'll see all your `[Main]`, `[Swapper]`, `[Serializer]`, etc. plugin logs immediately:

```json
{
  "logs": [
    {
      "timestamp": 1759747593482,
      "level": "log",
      "message": "[Main] ✓ Instance Swapping: 0 swapped, 20 unmatched",
      "source": "figma"
    },
    {
      "timestamp": 1759747593880,
      "level": "log",
      "message": "[Serializer] Collected 280 variables, 144 paint styles",
      "source": "figma"
    }
  ]
}
```

**That's it!** No navigation, no browser setup, no complex configuration.

### For Cloud Mode (Figma Web)

If you're using cloud mode or need to navigate to a specific file:

```javascript
figma_navigate({ url: 'https://www.figma.com/design/...' })
figma_get_console_logs({ count: 100 })
```

**How It Works:**
- Monitors main page console (Figma web app)
- Monitors all Web Worker consoles (Figma plugins)
- Automatically detects when workers are created/destroyed
- Merges all console logs into a single stream
- Tags logs with source: `'plugin'`, `'figma'`, `'page'`

**If You Still Don't See Plugin Logs:**

1. **Check timing:** Make sure you run the plugin AFTER navigating
   ```javascript
   figma_navigate({ url: '...' })
   // Now run your plugin in Figma
   figma_get_console_logs() // Should capture plugin logs
   ```

2. **Check worker count:** Use `figma_get_status()` to verify workers are detected
   ```json
   {
     "consoleMonitor": {
       "isMonitoring": true,
       "workerCount": 2  // Should be > 0 when plugin is running
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Check log levels:** Use `level: 'all'` to ensure nothing is filtered
   ```javascript
   figma_get_console_logs({ level: 'all', count: 500 })
   ```

**Technical Details:**
The MCP uses Puppeteer's Worker APIs to:
- Enumerate existing workers via `page.workers()`
- Listen for new workers via `page.on('workercreated')`
- Attach console listeners to each worker
- Tag worker logs with `source: 'plugin'`

This is the same mechanism Figma's own DevTools uses, just exposed natively through the MCP.

### Issue: "Browser isn't currently running"

**Symptoms:**
- Error message: "The browser isn't currently running"
- `figma_get_status` shows `browser.running: false`

**Cause:**
You haven't called `figma_navigate` yet to initialize the browser.

**Solution:**

Always start with `figma_navigate`:

```javascript
figma_navigate({ url: 'https://www.figma.com/design/your-file-id' })
```

This tool:
- Launches the headless Chrome browser
- Initializes console monitoring
- Navigates to your Figma file

Then check status:

```javascript
figma_get_status()
```

Should show:
- `browser.running: true`
- `initialized: true`
- `consoleMonitor.isMonitoring: true`

**Note:** If using the public server at `https://figma-console-mcp.southleft.com`, browser launch is handled automatically and should work without issues.

---

### Issue: "Failed to retrieve console logs"

**Symptoms:**
- Error: "Console monitor not initialized"
- Error: "Make sure to call figma_navigate first"

**Solution:**
Always use this workflow:
```
1. figma_navigate({ url: 'https://www.figma.com/design/...' })
2. Wait for success response
3. Then use figma_get_console_logs()
```

---

### Issue: Screenshot Returns Empty Data

**Symptoms:**
- Screenshot tool succeeds but image is blank
- Base64 data is present but doesn't render

**Possible Causes:**
1. Page hasn't fully loaded yet
2. Plugin UI isn't visible
3. Timing issue

**Solution:**
```
1. figma_navigate({ url: 'https://www.figma.com/design/...' })
2. Wait 2-3 seconds (automatic in figma_navigate)
3. figma_take_screenshot({ target: 'full-page' })
```

Try different targets:
- `'full-page'` - Entire page including scrollable areas
- `'viewport'` - Currently visible area
- `'plugin'` - Plugin UI only (may need to be visible first)

---

### Issue: No Console Logs Captured

**Symptoms:**
- `figma_get_console_logs()` returns empty array
- Log count is 0

**Possible Causes:**
1. Plugin hasn't executed yet
2. Plugin doesn't produce console output
3. Logs are being filtered out

**Solutions:**

#### Check Plugin Execution
```
1. figma_navigate({ url: 'https://www.figma.com/design/...' })
2. Interact with the plugin in Figma
3. figma_get_console_logs({ level: 'all' })
```

#### Check Log Levels
Try different level filters:
```
figma_get_console_logs({ level: 'all' })     // Everything
figma_get_console_logs({ level: 'error' })   // Only errors
figma_get_console_logs({ level: 'log' })     // Only console.log
figma_get_console_logs({ level: 'warn' })    // Only warnings
```

#### Check Timing
```
1. figma_navigate({ url: '...' })
2. figma_get_status()  // Check log count
3. If logCount > 0, logs are being captured
```

---

### Issue: "Connection timed out" or Network Errors

**Symptoms:**
- Claude Desktop shows connection timeout
- Tools take very long to respond
- Intermittent failures

**Possible Causes:**
1. Cloudflare Workers cold start
2. Browser initialization takes time
3. Figma page load is slow

**Solutions:**

#### Allow More Time
The first call to `figma_navigate` can take 10-30 seconds:
- Browser needs to launch
- Figma needs to load
- Console monitoring needs to initialize

Just wait - subsequent calls will be faster!

#### Use figma_get_status
This is a lightweight call that doesn't require browser initialization:
```
figma_get_status()  // Fast, shows current state
```

#### Check Server Health
```bash
curl https://figma-console-mcp.southleft.com/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "Figma Console MCP",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "endpoints": ["/sse", "/mcp", "/test-browser"]
}
```

---

### Issue: Claude Desktop Not Seeing Tools

**Symptoms:**
- MCP server connected but no tools visible
- Tools list is empty

**Solutions:**

#### Check Configuration

**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma-console": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://figma-console-mcp.southleft.com/sse"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:** URL must be exactly `https://figma-console-mcp.southleft.com/sse` (note the `/sse` endpoint).

#### Restart Claude Desktop
After changing configuration:
1. Quit Claude Desktop completely
2. Restart it
3. Check the tools menu

#### Verify mcp-remote
Make sure `mcp-remote` is installed:
```bash
npm list -g mcp-remote
```

If not installed:
```bash
npm install -g mcp-remote
```

## Workflow Best Practices

### Recommended Workflow

```
# 1. Start session
figma_navigate({ url: 'https://www.figma.com/design/your-file' })

# 2. Check initial state
figma_get_status()

# 3. Work with plugin, then check logs
figma_get_console_logs({ level: 'error' })

# 4. Capture UI state
figma_take_screenshot({ target: 'plugin' })

# 5. Make code changes, reload
figma_reload_plugin({ clearConsole: true })

# 6. Clear for next test
figma_clear_console()
```

### Tips

**1. Always Navigate First**
- `figma_navigate` must be the first call
- It initializes everything
- Subsequent calls will fail without it

**2. Use figma_get_status for Health Checks**
- Lightweight and fast
- Shows browser state
- Shows log count without retrieving logs

**3. Clear Console Between Tests**
- Prevents old logs from mixing with new ones
- `figma_clear_console()` or `figma_reload_plugin({ clearConsole: true })`

**4. Be Patient on First Call**
- Browser launch takes time
- First navigation is slowest
- Subsequent operations are faster

**5. Check Error Messages**
- Error messages include helpful hints
- Often suggest the next step to try
- Include troubleshooting tips

## Technical Details

### Browser Session Lifecycle

1. **First Call to figma_navigate:**
   - Launches Puppeteer browser (10-15s)
   - Initializes console monitoring
   - Navigates to Figma URL
   - Starts capturing logs

2. **Subsequent Calls:**
   - Reuse existing browser instance
   - Much faster (1-2s)
   - Logs accumulated in circular buffer

3. **Session Timeout:**
   - Browser kept alive for 10 minutes
   - After timeout, automatically relaunches on next call

### Console Log Buffer

- **Size:** 1000 logs (configurable)
- **Type:** Circular buffer (oldest logs dropped when full)
- **Capture:** Real-time via WebSocket (Desktop Bridge Plugin)
- **Source Detection:** Automatically identifies plugin vs Figma logs

### Screenshot Format

- **Formats:** PNG (lossless), JPEG (with quality control)
- **Encoding:** Base64 for easy transmission
- **Targets:**
  - `full-page`: Entire page with scrollable content
  - `viewport`: Currently visible area only
  - `plugin`: Plugin iframe only (experimental)

---

## Environment Variables

For local development or custom deployments:

```bash
# Log level (trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal)
LOG_LEVEL=info

# Configuration file location
FIGMA_CONSOLE_CONFIG=/path/to/config.json

# Node environment
NODE_ENV=production
```

---

## Advanced Configuration

Create `~/.config/figma-console-mcp/config.json`:

```json
{
  "browser": {
    "headless": true,
    "args": ["--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled"]
  },
  "console": {
    "bufferSize": 2000,
    "filterLevels": ["log", "info", "warn", "error", "debug"],
    "truncation": {
      "maxStringLength": 1000,
      "maxArrayLength": 20,
      "maxObjectDepth": 5
    }
  },
  "screenshots": {
    "defaultFormat": "png",
    "quality": 95
  }
}
```

**Note:** Custom configuration is optional. The public server at `https://figma-console-mcp.southleft.com` uses sensible defaults that work for most use cases.
