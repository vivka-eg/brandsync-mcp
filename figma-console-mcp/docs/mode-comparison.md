# Installation Methods & Execution Modes - Complete Comparison

This document clarifies the differences between installation methods and execution modes to help you choose the right setup.

## Understanding the Architecture

The MCP server has **three execution modes** and **four setup methods**:

### Execution Modes (Where Code Runs)
1. **Remote Mode** - Runs in Cloudflare Workers (cloud, read-only)
2. **Cloud Mode** - Runs in Cloudflare Workers + Cloud Write Relay (cloud, read/write)
3. **Local Mode** - Runs on your machine (Node.js, full capabilities)

### Setup Methods (How You Connect)
1. **Remote SSE/HTTP** - URL-based connection (uses Remote Mode, read-only)
2. **Cloud Mode** - Remote endpoint + Cloud Write Relay via Desktop Bridge plugin (uses Cloud Mode)
3. **NPX** - npm package distribution (uses Local Mode)
4. **Local Git** - Source code clone (uses Local Mode)

### Authentication Methods (How You Authenticate)
1. **OAuth** - Automatic browser-based auth (Remote SSE only)
2. **Personal Access Token (PAT)** - Bearer token (Remote `/mcp` endpoint, Cloud Mode)
3. **Personal Access Token (PAT)** - Environment variable (NPX + Local Git)
4. **Pairing Code** - 6-character code to connect Desktop Bridge plugin to cloud relay (Cloud Mode only)

**Key Insight:** Your choice of mode determines both capability level and setup complexity.

## Authentication Comparison

### Remote SSE - OAuth (Automatic) ⭐ Simplest

**Method:** Remote read-only mode (SSE endpoint)

**How it works:**
1. First design system tool call triggers OAuth
2. Browser opens automatically to Figma authorization page
3. User authorizes app (one-time)
4. Token stored in Cloudflare KV (persistent across sessions)
5. Automatic token refresh when expired

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **TRUE zero-setup** - No manual token creation
- ✅ Per-user authentication
- ✅ Automatic token refresh
- ✅ Works with Free, Pro, and Enterprise Figma plans

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Requires internet connection
- ⚠️ Initial authorization flow required (one-time)
- ❌ Read-only — no write access

### Cloud Mode - PAT + Pairing Code

**Method:** Cloud Mode with write relay

**How it works:**
1. User creates PAT and provides it as Bearer token when connecting to `/mcp` endpoint
2. AI generates a 6-character pairing code (valid for 5 minutes)
3. User enters code in Desktop Bridge plugin (Cloud Mode toggle)
4. Relay authenticates the plugin-to-cloud connection
5. All write operations flow through the authenticated relay

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Write access without Node.js
- ✅ Pairing code adds a second factor of trust (plugin must be in the right file)
- ✅ Variables on any Figma plan via Plugin API

**Limitations:**
- ❌ Manual PAT creation required
- ❌ Pairing code expires after 5 minutes
- ⚠️ Must re-pair if connection drops

### NPX + Local Git - Personal Access Token (Manual)

**Method:** Both NPX and Local Git modes

**How it works:**
1. User creates PAT at https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/8085703771159-Manage-personal-access-tokens
2. Set as `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable in MCP config
3. MCP server uses PAT for all API calls
4. No automatic refresh (token valid for 90 days)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Works offline (for console debugging)
- ✅ No browser-based OAuth flow
- ✅ Simpler for single-user setups
- ✅ Full 94+ tools including real-time monitoring

**Limitations:**
- ❌ **Manual token creation required**
- ❌ Must manually refresh every 90 days
- ❌ Single shared token (no per-user auth)
- ❌ **Requires Desktop Bridge Plugin** (one-time import)

**Why NPX ≠ Simpler:** Despite being distributed via npm, NPX has identical authentication complexity to Local Git. The only difference is distribution method, not setup complexity.

## Figma Desktop Bridge Plugin

### Required for Both Local Mode and Cloud Mode

The Desktop Bridge Plugin is the bridge between Figma and the MCP server. It communicates via WebSocket — no special Figma launch flags needed, and it persists across Figma restarts.

- **Local Mode:** Plugin connects directly to the local MCP server via WebSocket (ports 9223-9232)
- **Cloud Mode:** Plugin connects to the Cloudflare relay via WebSocket after pairing with a 6-character code

**Plugin Setup:**
1. Open Figma Desktop (normal launch — no debug flags needed)
2. Go to **Plugins → Development → Import plugin from manifest...**
3. Select `figma-desktop-bridge/manifest.json` from the figma-console-mcp directory
4. Run the plugin in your Figma file — it auto-connects via WebSocket

> **One-time import.** Once imported, the plugin stays in your Development plugins list.

**What the plugin provides:**

| Feature | Without Plugin | With Plugin (Cloud Mode) | With Plugin (Local Mode) |
|---------|----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Variables API | Enterprise plan required | ✅ Free/Pro plans work | ✅ Free/Pro plans work |
| Variable data | REST API (limited) | ✅ Full local variables | ✅ Full local variables |
| Component descriptions | Often missing (API bug) | ✅ Always present | ✅ Always present |
| Design creation (write) | ❌ | ✅ Via cloud relay | ✅ Via local WebSocket |
| Data freshness | Cache + API limits | Per-request via relay | ✅ Real-time from Figma |
| Selection tracking | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Real-time via WebSocket |
| Document change monitoring | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Real-time via WebSocket |

**Local Mode Transport:** The server automatically selects an available port in the range 9223–9232, supporting multiple simultaneous MCP instances. All 94+ tools work through the WebSocket transport.

**Cloud Mode Transport:** The plugin connects to the Cloudflare relay after pairing. Write operations are relayed from the cloud MCP server through the Durable Object to the plugin. (83 tools) are available.

### Plugin Does NOT Work with Remote Read-Only Mode

Remote read-only mode runs in Cloudflare Workers which cannot connect to `localhost` on your machine. The Desktop Bridge Plugin requires either a local MCP server (NPX or Local Git) or Cloud Mode pairing.

## Cost Comparison

All setup methods are completely free:

### Remote / Cloud Mode (Free - Hosted by Project)
- ✅ Free to use
- ✅ Hosted on Cloudflare Workers
- ✅ No infrastructure costs for users
- ⚠️ Shared rate limits (fair use)

### NPX (Free - Self-Hosted)
- ✅ Free to use
- ✅ Runs on your machine
- ✅ No external dependencies after setup
- ⚠️ Uses your CPU/memory

### Local Git (Free - Self-Hosted)
- ✅ Free to use
- ✅ Runs on your machine
- ✅ Full source code access
- ⚠️ Uses your CPU/memory

---

## Troubleshooting by Mode

### Remote Mode Common Issues
- **"OAuth authentication failed"** → Try re-authenticating via auth_url
- **"Browser connection timeout"** → Cold start (wait 30s, try again)
- **"Variables API 403 error"** → Enterprise plan required (use Cloud Mode or Local Mode instead)

### Cloud Mode Common Issues
- **Pairing code expired** → Ask your AI to generate a new pairing code (codes expire after 5 minutes)
- **Connection drops between AI turns** → Re-pair by asking your AI to reconnect and entering a fresh code in the plugin
- **"Cloud Mode" toggle not visible** → Re-import the manifest from `~/.figma-console-mcp/plugin/manifest.json` (one-time update to the bootloader version)
- **Plugin shows "Disconnected" in Cloud Mode** → Check your internet connection; the relay requires both the plugin and the cloud server to be online
- **Write operations not working** → Verify the Desktop Bridge plugin is running in the file you want to modify

### Local Mode Common Issues
- **"Failed to connect to Figma Desktop"** → Install the Desktop Bridge Plugin (Plugins → Development → Import from manifest) and run it in your file
- **"No plugin UI found"** → Make sure the Desktop Bridge Plugin is running in your Figma file
- **"Variables cache empty"** → Close and reopen Desktop Bridge plugin
- **Plugin shows "Disconnected"** → Make sure the MCP server is running (start/restart your MCP client)

---

## Summary

**For most users: Start with NPX Setup** ⭐
- All 94+ tools including design creation and real-time monitoring
- Automatic updates with `@latest`
- Desktop Bridge plugin support
- Variables without Enterprise plan

**Use Cloud Mode when:**
- You use web AI clients (Claude.ai, v0, Replit, Lovable)
- You need write access but can't install Node.js
- You don't need real-time selection/document tracking

**Use Local Git when:**
- You're developing the MCP server
- You want to modify source code
- You need unreleased features
- You're testing changes before contributing

**Use Remote (read-only) when:**
- You just want to explore/evaluate the tool
- You only need read-only access to design data
- You want zero-setup experience
- You don't need design creation capabilities

**Key Takeaway:** The three modes offer a clear capability progression:
- **Remote (read-only):** 22 tools — view data, screenshots, design system extraction
- **Cloud Mode:** (83 tools) — adds full write access (create, edit, delete) via relay
- **Local Mode (NPX/Git):** 94+ tools — adds real-time monitoring (selection, changes, console)

The difference is not just authentication, but **fundamental capabilities**:
- **Remote:** Cannot create, modify, or delete anything in Figma
- **Cloud:** Full design creation and variable management via the Desktop Bridge relay
- **Local:** Everything in Cloud, plus real-time selection tracking, document change monitoring, and console log streaming
