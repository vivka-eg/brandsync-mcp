description: "An objective comparison of Figma's official MCP server and Figma Console MCP — shared capabilities, real differences, and when to use which."
---

Both tools can now read and write to Figma. Both support skills and guided workflows. So what's actually different?

The short answer: **approach** and **audience**. The Figma MCP is a task-driven agent tool optimized for code-to-canvas workflows. Figma Console MCP is a design system ecosystem tool built to keep design and development in sync. They overlap significantly, and they work well together.

## Shared Ground

With Figma's March 2026 `use_figma` update, both tools now share a significant set of capabilities:

| Capability | Figma MCP | Console MCP |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Read file structure, components, styles | Yes | Yes |
| Export screenshots | Yes | Yes |
| Read variables / design tokens | Yes | Yes |
| Search design system assets across libraries | Yes | Yes |
| Create frames, shapes, text nodes | Yes (via `use_figma`) | Yes (dedicated tools) |
| Create components and component sets | Yes (via `use_figma`) | Yes (dedicated tools) |
| Modify auto-layout, fills, strokes | Yes (via `use_figma`) | Yes (dedicated tools) |
| Create and manage variables | Yes (via `use_figma`) | Yes (11 dedicated tools) |
| Resize, move, clone, delete nodes | Yes (via `use_figma`) | Yes (dedicated tools) |
| Execute arbitrary Plugin API JavaScript | No | Yes (`figma_execute`) |
| Structured create/edit/delete operations | Yes (`use_figma`) | Yes (dedicated tools) |
| Skills (markdown workflow guides) | Yes | Yes |

Both support skills — markdown instruction files that teach agents patterns, gotchas, and workflows before executing tool calls. Skills are a Claude Code feature, not specific to either MCP server. The key difference is in how write access is surfaced: Figma MCP uses a single server-side `use_figma` tool that handles structured operations through Figma's cloud. Figma Console MCP uses a WebSocket Desktop Bridge to execute Plugin API calls directly, exposing 94+ purpose-built tools with schema validation.

## Where They Diverge

### Tooling Philosophy

This is the most fundamental difference and it shapes everything else.

**Figma MCP** provides one powerful generic tool (`use_figma`) that handles structured create, edit, delete, and inspect operations through Figma's cloud infrastructure. Skills (markdown instruction files) guide the agent's behavior, teaching it patterns like font loading, color ranges (0-1 not 0-255), and auto-layout ordering.

**Figma Console MCP** provides 94+ purpose-built tools, each with its own schema, validation, error messages, and AI guidance. Instead of writing `figma.createFrame()` code, you call `figma_create_child` with structured parameters. Instead of scripting a variable loop, you call `figma_batch_create_variables` with a JSON array of 100 tokens.

| Aspect | Figma MCP | Console MCP |
|---|---|---|
| **Write approach** | 1 generic tool + skills | 94+ specialized tools |
| **Variable creation** | One-at-a-time via `use_figma` | `figma_batch_create_variables` (100/call) |
| **Error handling** | Agent must interpret raw JS errors | Tool-specific error messages with suggestions |
| **Validation** | Skills teach patterns, agent must follow | Schema-validated inputs, type-checked params |
| **Batch operations** | Agent scripts loops manually | 10-50x faster atomic batch tools |

**Why this matters:** For a single component, both approaches work fine. For a design system with 500 tokens across 4 modes, dedicated tools with batch operations are dramatically faster and more reliable than repeated code execution.

### Design System Management

Figma Console MCP was built for design system teams. These tools have no equivalent in Figma MCP:

| Capability | Figma MCP | Console MCP |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Batch create variables (up to 100/call) | No | Yes |
| Batch update variables (up to 100/call) | No | Yes |
| Atomic token system setup (collection + modes + variables) | No | Yes |
| Design-code parity analysis (8 dimensions) | No | Yes |
| AI-complete component documentation | No | Yes |
| Design system health scoring | No | Yes |
| Token enrichment and dependency mapping | No | Yes |
| Hardcoded value detection | No | Yes |
| Per-variant color token analysis | No | Yes |
| Component reconstruction specifications | No | Yes |
| Design linting | No | Yes |
| Design annotations (read, write, clear) | No | Yes (3 dedicated tools) |
| Annotation-enriched component docs | No | Yes |

### Code-to-Design Bridge (Figma MCP Strengths)

These are Figma MCP's genuine differentiators:

| Capability | Figma MCP | Console MCP |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Code Connect (map components to code) | Yes (first-party) | No |
| AI-suggested Code Connect mappings | Yes | No |
| Framework-specific code output (React, Vue, etc.) | Yes (built-in) | Via AI interpretation |
| Design system rules generation | Yes | No |
| Capture live web pages into Figma layers | Yes (`generate_figma_design`) | No |
| Create FigJam diagrams from Mermaid syntax | Yes (`generate_diagram`) | No |
| Create new blank Figma files | Yes (`create_new_file`) | No |
| Figma community skills page | Yes | No |

<Note>
Code Connect is a significant advantage for teams that want to map Figma components directly to their codebase components. This creates a bridge where the AI knows which code component corresponds to each design component — making code generation more accurate.
</Note>

### Real-Time Awareness

Figma Console MCP's Desktop Bridge provides live awareness that has no equivalent in Figma MCP:

| Capability | Figma MCP | Console MCP |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Track what the user has selected | No | Yes, in real time |
| Monitor document changes as they happen | No | Yes |
| Track page navigation events | No | Yes |
| Stream console logs from plugins | No | Yes |
| Live plugin reload for development | No | Yes |
| Multi-file connection tracking | No | Yes |
| Connection health diagnostics | No | Yes |

### FigJam, Slides, Comments, and Annotations

| Capability | Figma MCP | Console MCP |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Read FigJam boards | Yes | Yes |
| Create FigJam diagrams (Mermaid) | Yes | No |
| Structured FigJam tools (stickies, connectors, tables, etc.) | No | Yes (9 dedicated tools) |
| Figma Slides (create, edit, manage) | No | Yes (83 tools) |
| File comments (read, post, delete) | No | Yes |
| Design annotations (read, write, clear, categories) | No | Yes (3 dedicated tools) |

## A Note on the Evolution

When we first published this comparison in early 2025, the Figma MCP was a read-only, design-to-code tool. The landscape has changed significantly since then. Figma's addition of `use_figma` is a meaningful step toward making the Figma canvas programmable by AI agents.

Figma Console MCP's role has also evolved. Where we once differentiated primarily on write access, our focus has sharpened on what we do best: design system ecosystem management, design-code parity, and bridging the gap between design and development disciplines.

Both tools are better together. Use the one that fits your workflow, or use both.
